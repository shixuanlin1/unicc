# News Xenophobia Analysis Tool

## Overview
This is a Streamlit-based web application designed to analyze news articles for xenophobic content. The tool allows users to input news text or upload PDF/Word documents, and it uses the Dify API to classify the level of xenophobia in the text. The analysis includes classification, sentiment, subject category, and relevant keywords.

## Features
- **Text Input**: Users can directly enter news content.
- **File Upload**: Supports uploading PDF and Word (`.docx`) files.
- **Xenophobia Classification**: Classifies the news on a scale from 1 to 4.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines the sentiment of the article (negative, neutral, positive).
- **Subject Categorization**: Identifies the main topics and categories of the content.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Provides a list of relevant keywords.

## Configuration
### Dify Workflow
The Dify workflow is configured to analyze the news content and return the results in XML format. The configuration includes:
- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini
- **Prompt Template**: A detailed prompt to guide the LLM in classifying the news, determining sentiment, categorizing the subject, and extracting keywords.
- **Output Format**: XML format with specific tags for classification, reason, sentiment, and subject category.

### Example Output
```xml
<Classification>3</Classification>
<Reason>The article contains language that is moderately xenophobic. It uses terms and phrases that promote negative stereotypes about a specific group, but does not explicitly call for violence or extreme actions.</Reason>
<Sentiment>Negative</Sentiment>
